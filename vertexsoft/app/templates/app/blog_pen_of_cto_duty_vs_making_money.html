<p class=MsoTitleCxSpLast><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:24.0pt'>Duty vs
Making Money ("Dehari Lagana")</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:106%'>In
Pakistani Society a job is performed solely to make money. Since the purpose of
job is to make money so during duty by which means money could be made is also
kept in consideration by employees. In local language this process is also
given a name and that is "Dehari Lagana" (Money Making).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:106%'>For
the purpose of "Dehari Lagana" (to make money), delegated authority by the
employer are also misused. For example, if a person is doing job in a telecom
company in Pakistan, for "Dehari Lagana" purpose, he will leak the sms of some
one on request of his friends for good will or for money. If there is a police
officer, he will harass other for "Dehari Lagana" on request of some of his
buddy. If there is a bank manager, he will open a bogus account on the request
of any of his buddy. List of "Dehair Lagana" is long and is present in every
field.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:106%'>The
misuse of Authority for the purpose of "Dehari Lagana" has negative effect on
the society, because someone is given extra favor in return of cash or good
will and someone else is deprived of his due rights by keeping aside merit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:106%'>The
thinking of "Dehari Lagana" is produced because a job is done not by keeping in
mind that the job is to perform the duty, but by keeping in mind that job is
just money making. Since the purpose is money making so by which means money
could be produced on the job are also considered legitimate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:106%'>A
job should only be done by focusing to deliver and to contribute to the society
and to gain satisfaction through delivering. Of course, there are needs of the
employee which are required to be fulfilled and money is required for it so compensation
in the form of wage is also mandatory thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:106%'>But
if you think that your duty is not paying you much money to fulfill your needs,
don't think of "Dehari Lagana" but think to do progress in your profession by
moving to higher position or by switching through your commitment and
dedication to the duty. Even if in worst case you have to switch your employer,
it is better than sticking with one employer and start "Dehari Lagana".</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:106%'>Conclusion
of the story is that job should be done by considering it duty. If you are
delivering and employer is not compensating you then employer is not delivering
his duty but it doesn't justify that you start "Dehari Lagana". You should try
to move to a higher rank either by the same employer or to new one.</span></p>
